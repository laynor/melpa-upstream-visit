;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides an interactive command to `browse-url' a
;; melpa-hosted package's homepage.
;;
;; To (try to) visit a package's homepage, just
;;   M-x muv RET package-name RET
;; and the package's homepage (actually, its repo page) will be hopefully
;; opened in your browser.
;;
;; The list of kludges used to guess the package's homepage is stored
;; in `muv:url-kludges', a variable that you can customize with your
;; own functions.
;;
;; These functions are applied to a melpa recipe and return a string
;; containing the URL of the package - note that here applied refers
;; to `apply'.  See `muv::github-kludge' for an example.
;;
;; The kludges in the list are applied in order until one of them
;; returns non-nil. The first non-nil result is then interpreted
;; as the URL to be visited.
